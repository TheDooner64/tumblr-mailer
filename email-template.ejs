    <p>Hey <%= firstName %>,</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I hope you're doing well. It's been like <%= numMonthsSinceContact %> months
      since we last talked, so I figured I would give you a quick update on what I've been up to.
      I'm currently learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and really enjoying it.

    <p>
      I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog.
      Check out my recent posts:
      <ul>
        <% for (var i=0; i < latestPosts.length; i++) {%>
        <li><a href=<%= latestPosts[i].post_url %>> <%= latestPosts[i].title %></a></li>
        <% } %>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk soon,<br>
